# Gopher-Bin
Code for building a smart bin that uses Convolutional Neural Networks to segregate waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials.


This was created by me and my team that I lead. It is a self-driven, independent project for SASE Labs.

The code has been developed using Python, Tensorflow, and Tensorflow Lite, along with the Raspberry Pi and has a custom-trained CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model by us.

The project was built from November 2021 - April 2022.
