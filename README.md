# Gopher-Bin
Code for building a smart bin that uses Convolutional Neural Networks to segregate waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials.


This was created by me and my team and as a self-driven, independent project for SASE Labs.

The code has been developed using Python, Tensorflow, and Tesnforflow Lite, along with the Raspberry Pi and has a custom-trained CNN(Convulational Neural Network) model by us.

The project was built from November 2021 - April 2022. 

A presentation related to my team, the Vision team, and the other teams that I lead has been added to the repository.
